<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Please note that, since this project is developed as an in-class project, and the instance may not be kept running all the time, please follow the following steps to try this code out:</p>
<p>
1. Please ensure that you have a running server instance that you may use.<br>
2. Please ensure that you have Node and NPM installed on your server.<br>
3. If you don't have Node and NPM installed on your server yet, please access your server in your terminal, and type in the following code to install Node and NPM:<br>
  
```
$ curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo bash -
$ sudo yum install -y nodejs
```

4. After you have the server instance set up and ready, download the code from github and store it in a desired repository on your server, and go to that directory by calling:<br>

  ```
  cd /replace/this/part/with/your/directory
  ```
5. Then on your terminal, call:<br>
  
  ```
  node chat-server.js
  ```
